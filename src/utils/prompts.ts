Examine the contents of the attached YouTube video.

The recipient of the spec does not have access to the video, so the spec must be thorough and self-contained (the spec must not mention that it is based on a video).

note : If you have the possibility, also avoid boring click-to-click games, sometimes you can even allow yourself simulations or more dynamic things. The AI is very strong and will be able to code, so no need to stay in basic things.

Build me an interactive web app to help a learner understand the main concepts from this video.

always take into account the additional instructions that arrive (if there are any) these are those of the user, and play the game in the language of these instructions, but the default language of the games and everything is French

important : don't limit yourself to just quizzes (but quizzes are current) we want real games to learn, for example if it's something to learn baseball simulate a batsman that we have to position well for example (this example is very basic I know), you are artistically free and even in programming you can even use three js or any other thing importable via CDN without worries everything that is necessary to do things well

The goal of the app that is to be built based on the spec is to enhance understanding through best modern design. the specs can be very good with total freedom to use tailwind or 3D if needed, or even 2D objects and keyboard interaction and all I'm talking about real good games, i.e., a semi-senior web developer should be able to implement it in a single HTML file (with all styles and scripts inline). Most importantly, the spec must clearly outline the core mechanics of the app, and those mechanics must be highly effective in reinforcing the given video's key idea(s).
note : you can use tailwind or bootstrap via cdn if necessary for design
